    It has survived - not only (five) centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining -3-5 essentially 6*9/(3+4) unchanged. It was popularised in the 5*(1+2*(3/(4-(1-56-47)*73)+(-89+4/(42/7)))+1) with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
    It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using (-71+(2+3/(3*(2+1/2+2)-2)/10+2))/7 Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using (Content here), content here', making it look like readable English.
    It is a (7+5*12*(2+5-2-71))/12 established fact that a reader will be of a page when looking at its layout.
